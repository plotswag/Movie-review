# Sentiment Analysis with RNN on IMDb Dataset  
ðŸ”— Live App: [https://sentiment-analysis-rnngit-xesrdfyvncj5aky3r4yrl8.streamlit.app/](https://sentiment-analysis-rnngit-xesrdfyvncj5aky3r4yrl8.streamlit.app/)

## Project Overview:

This project is a sentiment analysis application built using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented in PyTorch. It classifies IMDb movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**.

The workflow consists of:
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews.
- Tokenizing and padding the text data using TensorFlow's tokenizer.
- Training an RNN model to learn patterns in text sequences.
- Saving the trained model and tokenizer.
- Creating an interactive web app using **Streamlit** to make real-time predictions on user-entered reviews.

The app allows anyone to input a movie review and instantly get a sentiment prediction.
